# Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Competition Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This Kaggle competition asks you to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Challenge
Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Dataset
- `train.csv`: Training set containing passenger data with survival outcomes
- `test.csv`: Test set for making predictions
- `submission.csv`: Sample submission file

## Files
- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Model building and prediction notebook

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. Prediction and submission
