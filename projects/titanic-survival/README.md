# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers including:
- Demographics (age, sex, class)
- Family information (siblings, parents/children)
- Ticket information (fare, cabin, embarkation port)
- Survival outcome (target variable)

## Files
- `titanic_prediction.py`: Main prediction script
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis

## Features Engineering
- Handling missing values
- Creating new features (family size, title extraction)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling

## Algorithms Implemented
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Support Vector Machine

## How to Run

### Python Script
```bash
python titanic_prediction.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb
```

## Learning Objectives
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Model comparison
- Feature importance analysis
