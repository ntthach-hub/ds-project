# Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Competition Overview
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. This competition challenges you to predict house prices using 79 explanatory variables.

## Challenge
Predict the final price of each home using advanced regression techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes
- Train and test sets
- Various types of features (numeric, categorical, ordinal)

## Files
- `house_prices_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
- `house_prices_model.ipynb`: Feature engineering and modeling
- `advanced_techniques.ipynb`: Advanced regression techniques

## Approach
1. Comprehensive EDA
2. Handling missing values
3. Feature engineering (creating new features)
4. Feature transformation (log, square root, etc.)
5. Encoding categorical variables
6. Feature scaling
7. Model stacking and ensembling
8. Hyperparameter tuning
